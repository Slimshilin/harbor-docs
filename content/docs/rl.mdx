description: Reinforcement learning on Harbor tasks
---

Performing RL on containerized agentic tasks is a common use case but difficult to implement and scale. Harbor provides a simple interface for training on containerized agentic environments.

We plan to integrate with most popular RL frameworks. For now, we have worked with the SkyRL team to implement their interface for RL on Harbor tasks. 

In general, performing RL on Harbor tasks requires generating rollouts and recording tokens and rewards. This usually involves implementing a RL framework's rollout interface.

We recommend using the `TrialConfig` or `JobConfig` classes to generate the rollouts. We also recommend using [cloud sandboxes](/docs/cloud) for scaling rollouts and reducing startup/teardown overhead.

In Harbor, a trial is an agent's attempt at completing a task. A job is a collection of trials.

Here is an example of a trial config:

```json
{
    "task": {
        "path": "cancel-async-tasks",
        "git_url": "https://github.com/laude-institute/terminal-bench-2.git",
        "git_commit_id": "69671fbaac6d67a7ef0dfec016cc38a64ef7a77c"
    },
    "trials_dir": "jobs/my-trial",
    "agent": {
        "name": "terminus-2",
        "import_path": null,
        "model_name": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
    },
    "environment": {
        "type": "daytona",
        "force_build": false,
        "delete": true,
    }
}
```

And here is an example of a job config:

```json
{
    "jobs_dir": "jobs",
    "orchestrator": {
        "type": "local",
        "n_concurrent_trials": 32,
        "retry": {
            "max_retries": 2,
            "exclude_exceptions": [
                "AgentTimeoutError",
                "VerifierTimeoutError"
            ]
        }
    },
    "environment": {
        "type": "daytona",
        "force_build": false,
        "delete": true,
    },
    "agents": [
        {
            "name": "terminus-2",
            "model_name": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
        }
    ],
    "datasets": [
        {
            "registry": {
                "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laude-institute/harbor/main/registry.json"
            },
            "name": "terminal-bench",
            "version": "2.0"
        }
    ]
}
```
